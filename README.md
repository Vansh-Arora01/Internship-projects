ðŸ©º Multiple Disease Predictor
This project is a machine learning-based disease prediction system developed in Python. It uses a dataset containing various symptoms and their associated diagnoses to train a model capable of predicting multiple diseases. The dataset is processed using Pandas, and a Random Forest Classifier from scikit-learn is used to build the predictive model. The system splits the data into training and testing sets, trains the model, and evaluates its performance using classification metrics. This project showcases how machine learning can assist in early and accurate disease detection based on symptom input.
